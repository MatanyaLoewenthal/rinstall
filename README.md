Rust CLI app for reinstalling programs after upgrading or changing a Linux OS

Usage is simple, just run `rinstall apply <some yaml file>` and rinstall will install all the packages in that yaml. Eventually there will be a `rinstall capture <some output yaml>`. 


This is going to be a personal tool as of now, so nothing too fancy.
